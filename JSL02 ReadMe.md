# JSL02 Project Brief: Task Input and Status Validation System

As a student of CodeSpace, we are currently expanding our coding knowledege. This project is a starting point for our JavaScript series. Over the next few weeks, I will be turning a static task board into an interactive task manager one project at a time.

## 🟢 Technologies:
1- Html
2- CSS
3- JavaScript

## 🟢 Setup:
1- As a programmer interacting with this file, you need to have VS Code beacuse that is the editor we will be using. 
2- The project was forked from a git link provided by CodeSpace.


## 🟢 Project Description:
JSL02, this is the name of this project. I was required to add a prompt for the user of the Kanban Board for two tasks. Each Task must prompt the following:
 
![title prompt](./explainer-images/title%20prompt.png)

 
 
 This needs to be done for Task 1 and Task 2. Thereafter, each task must be updated with a description. The user will also be prompted to say whether their task is in progress or done. Depending on the status, the last step of this project was to place a message on the console, it will have the name of the completed task and the staus will say done. If both tasks are not done it will provide a motivational message. Here is a visual aid as an example:
 
![invalid status](./explainer-images/no%20completed%20tasks%20log.png)
 

 ## 🟢 Extra's:
 There is no specific software you need to download at this point. As long as your device is web enabled you will be able to view this site. 

 As the project progresses, more information about how to use this site will be added for updating my future self.
